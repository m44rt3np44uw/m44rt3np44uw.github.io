Today I found out you can give a FTP connection (via site manager) a background color. This can be very useful. Because you can use the colors to remind yourself in which environment you are.

#### The colors I use are

| Color  | Environment |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Red    | Production  |
| Yellow | Staging     |
| Green  | Local       |
